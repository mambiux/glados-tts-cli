# GLaDOS Text-to-speech (TTS) Voice Generator
Neural network based TTS Engine.


--- You can also use the cli version to just call the command with what you want it to say 


If you want to just play around with the TTS, this works as stand-alone.
```console
python3 glados-tts/glados.py
```

the TTS Engine can also be used remotely on a machine more powerful then the Pi to process in house TTS: (executed from glados-tts directory
```console
python3 engine-remote.py
```

Default port is 8124
Be sure to update settings.env variable in your main Glados-voice-assistant directory:
```
TTS_ENGINE_API			= http://192.168.1.3:8124/synthesize/
```


## Description
The initial, regular Tacotron model was trained first on LJSpeech, and then on a heavily modified version of the Ellen McClain dataset (all non-Portal 2 voice lines removed, punctuation added).

* The Forward Tacotron model was only trained on about 600 voice lines.
* The HiFiGAN model was generated through transfer learning from the sample.
* All models have been optimized and quantized.
